# OSMAP
## A school's all in one solution

### Welcome to OSMAP!
An Open-Source **Online School Management & Administration Platform**

It Includes <ins>everything!</ins> from Homework to Accounting! 
And it's all **100% customizable!**

Don't need a feature? **Remove it!**\
Need a new one not included? **Make it!**

That's the beauty of *Open-Source* projects.\

## Teachers

The teachers are the core of education, and OSMAP has many different features for them:
### Attendance

From the [attendance](https://ilgiorg.github.io/osmap/attendance.html) the class is selected.
On the class' page, the teacher can take attendance, view attendance records and **download the form list** of students and their data in pdf.

> [!TIP]
> Print in PDF the Form List to bring on trips, where laptops can be uncomfortable to bring!

### Conduct
> [!WARNING]
> Due to Github Page restrictions, the conduct management feature is not available directly to try. This feature is fully implemented and working on [OmniSchool](https://github.com/IlGiorg/OmniSchool)


*OSMAP* Offers a _tiered_ system for conduct management.
From the teacher's portal, different levels of punishment can be selected: *L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5*
With every conduct record assigned, a description is also requested to ensure maximum clarity between Teachers and Families.

Schools can shape this feature around their system.\
For example: Only descriptions can be used without the tiered system, or levels can be removed or added!

Rewarding is also importnt, and to let students know they've done good work, **Housepoints** can be assigned through the conduct portal.

> [!NOTE]
> If a school doesn't have _Academic Houses_, they can be renamed just as "Positive Points".

### Grades
>[!WARNING]
>This feature has not been implemented in this repository. Check out [OmniSchool](https://github.com/IlGiorg/OmniSchool) to use this feature.

Teachers can give grades for assignments and have an overview of their class and single students.\
Teachers can then give a "Period Grade" that will automatically go into the system and the into the student's report card.

### Homework
>[!WARNING]
>This feature has not been implemented in this repository. Check out [OmniSchool](https://github.com/IlGiorg/OmniSchool) to use this feature.

Teachers can assign homework easily to a class and multiple classes at once. They can upload files as resources to the assignment to help students.

### Students Database
>[!WARNING]
>This feature has not been implemented in this repository. Check out [OmniSchool](https://github.com/IlGiorg/OmniSchool) to use this feature. 

Teachers can view all of the students in the database, view per class or just one student.\
We're planning to have to option to add a student's picture in the database, but it's not a feature currently implemented.

## Admin Panel
>[!WARNING]
>This feature has not been implemented in this repository. Check out [OmniSchool](https://github.com/IlGiorg/OmniSchool) to use this feature.

From the Admin Panel, all the *Behind the Scenes* happens.\
Students and Teachers can be created and deleted and raw SQL code is executed.
To ensure an added layer of security, a second layer of authentication is required to access the Admin Panel and an additional password to execute raw SQL code.
Other features are coming soon to the Admin Panel.
