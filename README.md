# OSMAP
## A school's all in one solution

### Welcome to OSMAP!
An Open-Source **Online School Management & Administration Platform**

It Includes <ins>everything!</ins> from Homework to Accounting! 
And it's all **100% customizable!**

Don't need a feature? **Remove it!**\
Need a new one not included? **Make it!**

That's the beauty of *Open-Source* projects.\

## Teachers

The teachers are the core of education, and OSMAP has many different features for them:
### Attendance

From the [attendance](https://ilgiorg.github.io/osmap/attendance.html) the class is selected.
On the class' page, the teacher can take attendance, view attendance records and **download the form list** of students and their data in pdf.

> [!TIP]
> Print in PDF the Form List to bring on trips, where laptops can be uncomfortable to bring!

### Conduct
> [!WARNING]
> Due to Github Page restrictions, the conduct management feature is not available directly to try.\ This feature is fully implemented and working on [OmniSchool](https://github.com/IlGiorg/OmniSchool)
*OSMAP* Offers a _tiered_ system for conduct management.
From the teacher's portal, different levels of punishment can be selected: *L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5*
With every conduct record assigned, a description is also requested to ensure maximum clarity between Teachers and Families.

> [!TIP]
> Schools can shape this feature around their system:\
> For example: Only descriptions can be used without the tiered system, or levels can be removed or added!

Rewarding is also importnt, and to let students know they've done good work, **Housepoints** can be assigned through the conduct portal
